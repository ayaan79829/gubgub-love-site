    <h1>For My Gubgub 💖</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Hi baby, it's me, Ayyan. I made this little corner of the internet just for you — because you're that special to me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How We Met ✨</h2>
      <p>It all started with a name. I typed "Brooke" into Snapchat just because I love the name — and somehow, the universe showed me <strong>you</strong>. We started talking on <strong>December 1st</strong>, and from the very first day, we liked each other. Like, actually <em>liked</em> each other. It was instant, it was real, it was meant to be.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why I Love You 💘</h2>
      <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
        <li>➤ You're so amazing.</li>
        <li>➤ You're cute in ways I can't even explain.</li>
        <li>➤ You're loving, sweet, and just… everything.</li>
        <li>➤ You make me feel like the luckiest guy ever.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Our Silly Side 🤭</h2>
      <p>You’re seriously the funniest person I know. Whether you’re roasting me playfully or making up the most random jokes, you always know how to make me laugh like an idiot. It’s one of the many things that makes being with you feel so light and happy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Meant to Be 💫</h2>
      <p>I believe in us. In love, in faith, and in how real this all feels. I don’t care what the world says — you’re mine and I’m yours. Forever kind of thing.</p>
      <p class="quote">“Some people search forever — I found you by typing your name.”</p>
